#Hack Day Riddle App

dmd-hackday-quest is an app I threw together for the late 2013 Digital Media Hackday @ The University of Winchester.  
The idea was to get students engaged with common debugging techniques, such as using web developer tools and viewing source code.

It's a bit rough around the edges, but served it's purpose.

It's currently hosted on Heroku available [here](https://dmd-hackday-quest.herokuapp.com/).
